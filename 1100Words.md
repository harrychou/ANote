##### It Takes More Than Medicine
If one were to look at the roster of physical handicaps, one would reach the 
**somber** conclusion that the list is long one. Included would be **stunted** 
development of an arm or leg due to a birth anomaly. Others would be the results
of a crippling disease which has caused muscles atrophy. The list would go on
with illnesses and injuries **maim** or **debilitate**. Modern medicine has done much 
to ameliorate the physical problems. However, there are an **inordinate** number of
problems of the handicapped which have still to be alleviated. People are not
usually callous, but in some **perverse** way they have the propensity to repress 
any concerns with the physically handicapped. The social problems seem to be
inherent in our own attitudes.

- somber: dark, serious, joyless
- stunted: prevented from growing/developing
- maim: (v) to wound seriously, loss of body parts
- debilitate: to make feeble, to weeken
- inordinate: excessively, unreasonable in magnitude
- perverse: deviate from right/normal, stubborn/inflexible in wrongful doing
    - pervasive

##### Doing the Right Thing
The obstacles which frustrate the physically handicapped person who is seeking
an employment may turn him into cynic. Too often a prospective employer, with
a rather **unctuous** manner, actually tends to degrade the handicapped by **proffering**
employment that is really beneath him and his abilities. The employer appears to
be acting in a benevolent manner, but this attitude shows no compassion, for
he expects the man seeking a job to remain **subservient**. This iniquity cannot but
give the handicapped a feeling that he is being discriminated against. He does
not expect a **sinecure**, but he has an aversion to the prevalent belief that he
should consider himself lucky to find an employment.

- unctuous: (of a person) excessively or ingratiatingly flattering; oily.
- proffer: hold out (something) to someone for acceptance; offer.
- subservient: 
- sinecure: SAI-nuh-kyur: a position requiring little or no work but giving the holder status or financial benefit. gravy train, easy money, ...

##### A Better Way

Why is there any question about the **propriety** of hiring the physically handicapped.
No one who understands their needs can **condone** this attitude. The offering of
employment should not be considered a largess. There should be no need to 
**vindicate** the hiring of handicapped. The only criterion should be what he is
capable of doing. If this is the approach, the handicapped will not feel he is
an **encumbrance** to his boss. The employer, on the other hand, will find it 
**conducive** to good work and will not repent his having tried something new and
to **mollify** his conscience. Even for the most **mercenary** employer, there should
be no **reticence** in eliciting the best which is possible from the handicapped 
worker.

- propriety: the state or quality of conforming to conventionally accepted standards of behavior or morals. social norm, accepted way ...
- condone: 
- vindicate: clear (someone) of blame or suspicion. (comp. vindictive: having or showing a strong or unreasoning desire for revenge)
- encumbrance: a burden or impediment.

- repent
- mollify: appease the anger or anxiety of (someone). ex: "nature reserves were set up around the power stations to mollify local conservationists"
- mercenary: (of a person or their behavior) primarily concerned with making money at the expense of ethics.
- reticence: reserve, wanting to avoid communication and not wanting to offer any more information than is necessary.
- eliciting

**a bolt from the blue** -- a great surprise.

##### Just Be Yourself

Socially, the handicapped person is often treated as a **pariah**. Too many
people hold themselves aloof from normal contact with those who are "different".
This social separation **propagates** the feeling of antipathy. If the normal 
individual would socialize with the handicapped individual, he would find in
a pragmatic way that those are people who happen to have a physical handicap;
the handicap does not make him less human. The iniquity of assuming that
physical superiority equals moral superiority prevents all of us from direct
human relationships. As long as there is a **vestige** of feeling that handicapped
is inferior we all are handicapped in one way or another. Under the **guise** of
physical superiority we demonstrate a moral **turpitude** that is harmful to all.

- pariah: an outcast.
- propagate:
- vestige: a trace of ... (vestigial: forming a very small remnant of something that was once much larger or more noticeable.)
- guise: outward appearance (disguise: To modify the manner or appearance of in order to prevent recognition. In other words to disguise is to hide one's true guise and to take on a false one. Often though, the word guise is used when describing the outward appearance of someone who is in disguise- as in my example above.)
- turpitude: depravity; wickedness. "acts of moral turpitude"

**to tell tales out of school**--to reveal harmful secrets.
The fact was in the fire for the politician when his private secretary
started telling tales out of school about his secret sources of income.

- fact is in the fire: said when something has been said or done that will cause a lot of trouble
