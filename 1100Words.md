##### It Takes More Than Medicine
If one were to look at the roster of physical handicaps, one would reach the 
**somber** conclusion that the list is long one. Included would be **stunted** 
development of an arm or leg due to a birth anomaly. Others would be the results
of a crippling disease which has caused muscles atrophy. The list would go on
with illnesses and injuries **maim** or **debilitate**. Modern medicine has done much 
to ameliorate the physical problems. However, there are an **inordinate** number of
problems of the handicapped which have still to be alleviated. People are not
usually callous, but in some **perverse** way they have the propensity to repress 
any concerns with the physically handicapped. The social problems seem to be
inherent in our own attitudes.

- somber: dark, serious, joyless
- stunted: prevented from growing/developing
- maim: (v) to wound seriously, loss of body parts
- debilitate: to make feeble, to weeken
- inordinate: excessively, unreasonable in magnitude
- perverse: deviate from right/normal, stubborn/inflexible in wrongful doing
    - pervasive

**to burn the midnight oil** --to study or work until very late.
- The radio was such an enigma that he had to burn the midnight oil for several
nights to get it working.

##### Doing the Right Thing
The obstacles which frustrate the physically handicapped person who is seeking
an employment may turn him into cynic. Too often a prospective employer, with
a rather **unctuous** manner, actually tends to degrade the handicapped by proffering
employment that is really beneath him and his abilities. The employer appears to
be acting in a benevolent manner, but this attitude shows no compassion, for
he expects the man seeking a job to remain subservient. This iniquity cannot but
give the handicapped a feeling that he is being discriminated against. He does
not expect a sinecure, but he has an aversion to the prevalent belief that he
should consider himself lucky to find an employment.

A Better Way

Why is there any question about the propriety of hiring the physically handicapped.
No one who understands their needs can condone this attitude. The offering of
employment should not be considered a largess. There should be no need to 
vindicate the hiring of handicapped. The only criterion should be what he is
capable of doing. If this is the approach, the handicapped will not feel he is
an encumbrance to his boss. The employer, on the other hand, will find it 
conducive to good work and will not repent his having tried something new and
to mollify his conscience. Even for the most mercenary employer, there should
be no reticence in eliciting the best which is possible from the handicapped 
worker.

The windfall from his distant cousin came like a bolt from the blue.
=================================================================================
Just Be Yourself

Socially, the handicapped person is often treated as a pariah. Too many
people hold themselves aloof from normal contact with those who are "different".
This social separation propagates the feeling of antipathy. If the normal 
individual would socialize with the handicapped individual, he would find in
a pragmatic way that those are people who happen to have a physical handicap;
the handicap does not make him less human. The iniquity of assuming that
physical superiority equals moral superiority prevents all of us from direct
human relationships. As long as there is a vestige of feeling that handicapped
is inferior we all are handicapped in one way or another. Under the guise of
physical superiority we demonstrate a moral turpitude that is harmful to all.

Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage, AngularJS powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

  - Type some Markdown on the left
  - See HTML in the right
  - Magic

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.
