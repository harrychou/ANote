- Counseling
    - sometimes called “talk therapy,” 
    - a conversation or series of conversations between a counselor and client. 
    - Counseling usually focuses on a specific problem and taking the steps to address or solve it. 
    - Problems are discussed in the present-tense, without too much attention on the role of past experiences.
    - comp. to psychotheraphy: 
        - Psychotherapy, like counseling, is based on a healing relationship between a health care provider and client.
        - Psychotherapy, or therapy for short, also takes place over a series of meetings, though often it has a longer duration than counseling. Some people participate in therapy off and on over several years.
        - Instead of narrowing in on individual problems, psychotherapy considers overall patterns, chronic issues, and recurrent feelings. 
        - This requires an openness to exploring the past and its impact on the present. 
        - The aim of psychotherapy is to resolve the underlying issues which fuel ongoing complaints. 
        - Psychotherapists help to resolve past experiences as part of laying the foundation for a satisfying future.
